# [Feilong Wang](http://feilongwang.org)'s [Configuration Files](https://github.com/feil0n9wan9/confiles)
These are configuration files for bash, vim, git, etc to setup a new system fast and easily.


## Installation
If you would like to see the old installation, check out [this branch](https://github.com/feil0n9wan9/confiles/tree/standby).

You'll need to make sure your system has `git` installed.

### Install script
To install or update fcfs, you can use the install script using `curl`:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feil0n9wan9/confiles/master/install.sh | bash
```
or `wget`
```bash
wget -q0- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feil0n9wan9/confiles/master/install.sh | bash
```

### About `$PATH`
If `~/.path` exist, it will be sourced along with the other files.

### About extra commands
If `~/.extra` exist, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use it to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to a public repository, or to override settings, functions and aliases from the repository.
